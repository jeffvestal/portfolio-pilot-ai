## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **MCP Server Connection Failed**
   - Verify Elasticsearch cluster is running on `localhost:9200`
   - Ensure MCP server feature is enabled in Elasticsearch (beta feature)
   - Check that MCP server is accessible at `localhost:5601/api/mcp`

2. **No Content in News/Reports Summaries**
   - Verify MCP server is designated for "main page data" in settings
   - Check that financial data exists in your Elasticsearch indices
   - Review backend logs for MCP tool execution errors

3. **Negative News Alerts Not Working**
   - Ensure your MCP server has the `neg_news_reports_with_pos` tool
   - Verify the tool accepts `time_duration` parameter (e.g., "48 hours")
   - Check server connectivity and tool availability in settings

4. **Article Summarization Failing**
   - Verify Azure OpenAI credentials are correct
   - Check that the article content is not empty
   - Review backend logs for streaming response errors

5. **Sentiment Analysis Showing "Unknown"**
   - Verify your Elasticsearch data includes sentiment fields
   - Check that MCP tools return sentiment data in expected format
   - Review backend logs for data parsing errors

6. **Chat Not Working**
   - Verify Azure OpenAI credentials in `.env` file
   - Check that MCP servers are connected and tools are discovered
   - Review conversation logs for authentication or tool execution errors

For additional help, check the backend logs and ensure all services are properly configured and running.
